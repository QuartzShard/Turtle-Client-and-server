# Tutle-upload-client
"Server\Data" must be an acessible FTP location for the client widget to access.
Programs written for this system cannot import turtle under a defined name, e.g import turtle as turt, as this breaks server-side execution, and must instead simply "import turtle", and student may define variables using the turtle object if they wish to shorten the name.
